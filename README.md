# Local Component Workbench

A guided local workbench for catalog discovery, qualified fixture runs, validation, history and reports.

**Version 0.1.0-rc.1 · GPL-3.0-only**  
**Copyright (C) 2026 RUSSELL PHILIP SMITHSON**

## Getting started

Read the [start guide](release/START_HERE.md) and [environment requirements](release/app/START_HERE.md).
This is a Windows prerelease using the declared, pinned local runtimes.
Use a short checkout path and keep new run state outside the release folder.
The application and all its source are under [release/app](release/app).

The catalog contains 393 entries. Three bounded fixture capabilities are runnable through two adapters; the remaining entries retain their stated limits.

## Integrity and evidence

The [release](release/) contains the original verified package, source,
documentation, examples and acceptance evidence. Its files are unchanged.
Run the following with an installed Python interpreter to check every file
against the preserved release manifest (this check needs only the standard
library and does not run the application):

```text
python verify_release.py
```

The repository disables Git text conversion so sealed file hashes survive
checkout. Historical local-only and earlier product-status descriptions in
the evidence describe the original build, not current publication status.
New publication metadata and licensing live outside the sealed release.

## Three separate products

- [Research Toolkit](https://github.com/LKVexa/Research-Toolkit)
- [Research Workbench](https://github.com/LKVexa/Research-Workbench)
- [Coding Agent Platform](https://github.com/LKVexa/Coding-Agent-Platform)

Each repository has its own application, state, version and release evidence.
The shared foundation is pinned within each release. Original deliveries and
the earlier local release packages remain preserved separately.
